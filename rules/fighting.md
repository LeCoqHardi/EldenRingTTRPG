## Elden Ring TTRPG Fighting System

Elden Ring TTRPG uses the DnD's fighting system, but adapted with Elden Ring items, buffes,debuffes and afflictions.

### The Combat Sequence

1. **Initiative:** At the start of combat, every participant rolls a d20. The highest roller goes first, and the order of turns is determined by the results.
    * *Example: Alice rolls a 17, Bob rolls a 12, and the Servant of Rot rolls a 14. So, the turn order is Alice, Servant of Rot, then Bob.*

2. **Turns:** Each creature takes a turn in the order determined by initiative.
3. **Actions and Movement:** On your turn, you typically perform one **action** and move a certain distance. Actions can include attacking, casting spells, using items, and more.
    * *Example: Alice attacks the Servant of Rot with her sword, then moves 30 feet to take cover behind a wall.*

### Core Combat Elements

* **Armor Class (AC):** Represents how difficult it is to hit a creature with an attack. A higher AC means a tougher target.
    * *Example: A heavily armored knight has an AC of 18, while a wizard might have an AC of 12.*

* **Hit Points (HP):** Indicate how much damage a creature can take before being knocked unconscious or dying.
    * *Example: A Dragon has 200 HP, a Vulgar Militiaman 7 HP.*

* **Attack:** To attack, you roll a d20 and add your **attack modifier** (Based on Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence or Fiath depending your weapon scaling). If the total equals or exceeds the target's AC, you hit.
    * *Example: Alice has a +4 attack modifier. She rolls a 15, for a total of 19. If the Servant of Rot has an AC of 16, she hits.*

* **Damage:** If you hit, you deal damage by rolling the dice specified for your weapon or spell and adding your damage modifiers.
    * *Example: Alice's sword deals 1d8+2 damage. If she rolls a 5 on the d8, she deals 5+2 = 7 damage to the Goblin.*

* **Conditions:** Effects like "blinded," "charmed," or "restrained" can affect a creature's abilities.
    * *Example: A blinded character has disadvantage on their attack rolls.*

* **Advantage and Disadvantage:** Certain situations grant advantage or disadvantage on a roll. With advantage, you roll twice and keep the higher result. With disadvantage, you keep the lower result.
    * *Example: If you surprise an enemy, you have advantage on your attack roll.*

### Additional Concepts

* **Surprise:** If you surprise an enemy, you can act before they do. (Known as backstab in game)
* **Opportunity Attacks:** If an enemy moves out of your reach, you might get an opportunity attack.
* **Range:** Ranged weapons have a limited range.
* **Cover:** Hiding behind an object can reduce your chances of being hit.
* **Mass Combat:** Special rules apply to large battles.

### Damage Types

#### Status effects (needs buildup)
* **Poison:** When inflicted by Poison, the victim suffers from damage-over-time. The exact damage and duration varies with source of Poison.
* **Scarlet Rot:** When inflicted by Scarlet Rot, the victim suffers from considerable damage-over-time. The exact damage and duration varies with source of Rot.
* **Blood Loss:** When inflicted by Blood Loss, the victim suffers instant damage based on their max HP.

* **Sleep:** When inflicted by Sleep, the victim falls asleep (3 turns) or briefly loses their balance.
* **Madness:** When consumed by Madness, the victim is briefly stunned and suffers damage based on max HP and FP.
* **Deathblight:** When taken by Death Blight, spires of pure death rapidly grow from their dead body, killing the victim immediately. 

### Buildup System
A buildup system implies that an affliction doesn't immediately take full effect but gradually increases in severity over time. This can be achieved by introducing a "buildup meter" or "stack counter" for each affliction.

**Example:** A Servant of Rot deals scarlet rot buildup. 

### Saving Throws

Saving throws are resistance checks made by a character to resist the effects of spells, traps, or other hazards. There are six types:

* **Strength (STR):** Resisting being pulled, pushed, or grappled.
* **Dexterity (DEX):** Resisting being hit by ranged attacks, traps, or sudden attacks.
* **Constitution (CON):** Resisting poisons, diseases, and damage over time.
* **Intelligence (INT):** Resisting illusions, mind-affecting effects, and spells that require concentration.
* **Wisdom (WIS):** Resisting charms, fear, and other mental effects.
* **Charisma (CHA):** Resisting being charmed or frightened.

**Example:** A Servant of Rot casts a *Pest Threads* spell. The target must make a *Constitution* saving throw to resist.

**Damage Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities:**

Many creatures and objects have vulnerabilities, resistances, or immunities to certain damage types.

* **Vulnerability:** Double damage from a specific type.
* **Resistance:** Half damage from a specific type.
* **Immunity:** No damage from a specific type.

**Example:** A Servant of Rot is *vulnerable* to fire damage but *resistant* to scarlet rot damage.
