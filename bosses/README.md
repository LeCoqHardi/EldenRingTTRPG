# BOSSES

The bosses of the Lands Between are the embodiment of the world's tumultuous history and its current state of disorder. These formidable adversaries, from the monstrous to the divine, are guardians of secrets, symbols of power, and remnants of a bygone era. To defeat them is not merely a test of skill, but a journey through the heart of the Elden Ring's mythos. Each victory brings the Tarnished closer to understanding the fractured world and its path to redemption.
